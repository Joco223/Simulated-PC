To load a program simply put it in as an argument in the command line (for example: "Debugger.exe SumTwoNumbers.cal")

You can step trough each instruction and see all the registers,
flags and both stacks content at each instruction. It also dynamicaly updates the memory content display
to show the current memory contents at that step. Use W to go to next instruction, S to go to the previous
one, E to go to the next page in memory (next addresses which can't currently be shown on screen) and D to
go to previous page in memory.
