#Simulated-PC Debugger

This is a Debugger for Simulated-PC.

It takes a normal Simulated-PC program and runs it, collects the data and shows it
in a nice fashion which allows you to step trough each instruction executed and see
all the available information from the Simulated-PC (Registers, flags, stack, memory...)
